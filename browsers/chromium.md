# Chromium

## Settings

Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.) have several of the features that Google Chrome does.
However, to access them, the default settings path for the browser doesn't work (e.g. `vivaldi://tracing`). To access
the ultimate settings window, you may need to type `chrome://tracing`.

### Window Examples

```
chrome://settings/autofill
chrome://tracing
```
